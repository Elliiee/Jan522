Introduction

Our friend circle is a huge graph.

Here is introducing 3 types of graph: undirected graphs, directed graphs, weighted graph.
1. undirected graphs: the edges between any two vertices do not have a direction.
2. directed graphs: the edges between any two vertices are directional.
3. weighted graphs: each edge has an associated weight, such as time, distance, size, etc.

Graph is a non-linear DS consisting of vertices and edges.
Vertex, vertices
Edge
Path
Path Length
Cycle
Negative Weight Cycle: the sum of the weights of all edges of a cycle is negative
Degree of a Vertex: applies to unweighted graphs; the number of edges connecting the vertex
In-Degree
Out-Degree
