Disjoint Set - Union by Rank (only works for quick union).

The word "rank" means ordering by specific criteria.

Choose the root of the taller tree as the new root,
so it will not increase the height of the tree after union.
(If their ranks are the same,
then either one of their root can be the new root.)
