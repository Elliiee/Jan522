Disjoint Set aka Union-Find

It is the way we quickly check whether two vertices are connected.
For instance, we can use a disjoint set to determine if two people share a common ancestor.

Terminologies
Parent node
Root node: a node without a parent node; it can be viewed as the parent node of itself

2 important function in a disjoint set:
find() : finds the root node of a vertex
union() : unions two vertices by making their root nodes the same
