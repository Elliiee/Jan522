    /*
    There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order with distinct
    values.
    Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an
    unknown pivot index k in [1, nums.length] such that the resulting array
    is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ...nums[n-1], nums[0], ...nums[k-1]].
    Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of the target
    if it is in nums, or -1, if it is not in nums;
    You must write an algorithm with O(logn) runtime complexity. //logN means binary search
